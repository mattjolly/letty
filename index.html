				<h2>Education</h2>
				<p>Letty has always believed that music performance and education go hand in hand and throughout her career, she has aimed to reach as many children and young people as possible. Letty has worked as a performer on education projects ranging from SEN workshops in special needs schools, to large-scale nationwide outreach projects with many of the UK&rsquo;s leading orchestras.</p>
				<p>She has demonstrated the French horn (including of course what makes it the best instrument!) to quite literally thousands of children and is happiest when sharing her love of music to new audiences.</p>
