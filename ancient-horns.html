	<h1>Ancient Horns</h1>
	<p class="major">Letty is currently undertaking research towards her PhD in Music Archaeology (to be completed in 2030) at the University of Manchester and National Museums Scotland.</p>
	<p>Her work focuses on ancient forms of horn and explores the relationship these instruments might have had with the societies they came from, as well as their links to social and ritual practices. </p>
	<p>Letty’s research highlights what we can learn through modern-day performance on analogue copies; how these instruments can be taken from ‘behind the cabinet’ of their museum home; as well as their huge potential for interaction and engagement with audiences of all ages and backgrounds. </p>

			<p>From 2020-2021, Letty was an Artist-in-Residence at Snape Maltings in Suffolk, where she developed her project <em>Ancient Horns</em> based around Etruscan and Ancient Greek instruments from the late Iron Age.</p>

			<p>These instruments included Karnyx, Lituus, Cornu and Salpinx, with her project aiming to give these ancient horns new voices in a modern-day context. Through collaborations with instrument-builder and historical expert Dr Peter Holmes, musicians Alice Zawadzki, Ed Ashby and Luke Christie and working with filmmaker John Fensom, Letty created the following film for the Festival of New at Snape Maltings.</p>

			<p>Letty was first commissioned to write for these fantastic instruments by PLAYLIST in 2019, where she performed her own site-specific composition <em>Cornicen / The Hornblower</em> in the atmospheric settings of the mediaeval Gods House Tower building in Southampton.</p>
			<p>Since then, Letty has worked with a number of composers commissioned to write for ancient horns, including Marc Pogolski, Bernd Redmann and Enrique Rueda. Letty worked with composer Lior Rosner (<em>X-Men</em>, <em>Game of Thrones</em>), to give the premiere of <em>Echoes of the Ancients</em> in 2023, performed in the Auditorio Nacional in Madrid. Letty has been broadcast live on BBC Radio 3 from Vindolanda Roman Fort.</p>

			<p>Letty has also worked on a number of major film and TV projects as a multi-instrumentalist and collaborative musician. These include Hollywood blockbusters <em>The Northman</em>, <em>Gladiator II</em> and <em>Nosferatu</em>.</p>
			<p>For The Northman, Letty worked with a research and development team at Middlesex University to build wooden lurs as part of the period-accurate approach to the film. Listen to the sounds of these lurs throughout this track ‘The King’ from the film score here:</p>
