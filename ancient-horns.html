				<h1>Ancient Horns</h1>
				<p>Letty is currently an Artist in Residence at Snape Maltings in Suffolk, where she is developing her project <em>Ancient Horns / New Voices</em> based around Etruscan and Greek instruments from the late-Bronze Age.</p>
				<p>The brass instruments she is working with include Carnyx, Lituus, Cornu and Salpinx and her project aims to give these ancient horns new voices in a modern-day context. Through collaborations with instrument-builder and historical expert Dr Peter Holmes, musicians Alice Zawadzki, Ed Ashby and Luke Christie and working with filmmaker John Fensom, she is in the process of developing a documentary film for the Festival of New at Snape Maltings.</p>
				<p>Letty was first commissioned to write for these fantastic instruments by PLAYLIST in 2019, where she performed her own site-specific composition <em>Cornicen / The Hornblower</em> in the atmospheric settings of the medieval Gods House Tower building in Southampton.</p>
