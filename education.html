		<h1>Education</h1>
		<p>Letty has always believed that music performance and education go hand in hand and throughout her career, she has aimed to reach as many children and young people as possible. Letty has worked as a performer on education projects ranging from SEN workshops in special needs schools, to large-scale nationwide outreach projects with many of the UK’s leading orchestras. </p>
		
		<p>She has demonstrated the French horn (including of course what makes it the best instrument!) to quite literally 1000’s of children and is happiest when sharing her love of music to new audiences. </p>

			<h2>Orchestral</h2>
		
			<p>Following on from her Master’s degree in Leadership from the Guildhall School of Music, Letty has worked extensively as both a performer and workshop leader with Britten Sinfonia (with whom she most recently presented UK KS1 tours of Alice Through the Looking Glass and Professor Astrocat; as well as leading several projects with young players from Britten Sinfonia Academy, most recently her forthcoming project Sketch the Sound at the Fitwilliam Museum in Cambridge, 2020), as well as with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (where she has recently worked on the Lullaby Project, songwriting with refugee mothers alongside workshop practitioners from Music In Prisons; SEN workshops in Berkshire and London led by Paul Griffiths; the Cambridge Adolescent Mental Health Project, working alongside Sigrun Saevarsdottir-Griffiths with Y6 children focussing on wellbeing and mental health; and with Brent Music Service and James Redwood, as part of its year as the 2020 Borough of Culture). Letty is also very much looking forward to working with the Aurora Orchestra in 2020 for a project in Heidelberg in Germany, celebrating Beethoven’s 250th anniversary on the Beethoven Ship through a project between UK and German participants, based around his Sixth Symphony. </p>

			<h2>Teaching</h2>

			<p>Letty is also passionate about teaching and holds the post of Head of Brass at Highgate School in North London, as well as teaching at Junior Trinity Laban conservatoire in Greenwich. She frequently coaches for the National Children’s Orchestra, both for national courses as well as for the London Seniors Orchestra. In 2020 she will be tutoring for the U-12’s and U-13’s orchestras and, as an ex-member of the NCO- and NYO-GB herself, Letty very much enjoys tutoring and coaching some of the UK’s finest young players. Letty also works regularly with Britten Sinfonia Academy musicians in a coaching capacity, as well as with the Aldeburgh Young Musicians, both coaching chamber music courses and also devising new work with these exceptionally talented young people. In summer 2020 she will take the lead with a collaboration between AYM and Perhaps Contraption as part of the Snape Proms, continuing devised and new composition work from a very successful project that she led in 2019. </p>
